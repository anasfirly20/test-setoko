This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How To Run The App

First, copy the HTTPS or the SSH and then open your terminal to clone it. Example: git clone "the HTTPS / SSH you copied"

Second, Open the folder in your code editor and then run "npm install" in your code editor's terminal to install the required dependencies

Third, in order to run the app smoothly you need to generate a Personal access token (classic) from github and create an .env file in the root of the application's directory. Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN = "Your generated personal access token"

Here is the link to the documentation to generate github's personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens

Lastly, after all those steps, run "npm run dev" in your code editor to run the application in your local host
